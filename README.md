## Problem

Lido DAO governance currently relies on Aragon voting model. This means DAO approves or rejects proposals via direct governance token voting. Though transparent and reliable, it is not a convenient way to make decisions only affecting small groups of Lido DAO members. Besides, direct token voting doesn't exactly reflect all the decision making processes within the Lido DAO and is often used only to rubberstamp an existing consensus.
There are a few natural sub-governance groups within the DAO, e.g. validators commitee, financial operations team and LEGO commitee. Every day they need to take routine actions only related to their field of expertise. The decisions they make hardly ever spark any debate in the comunity, and votings on such decisions often struggle to attract wider DAO attention and thus, to pass.

## Solution

Easy Track frictionless motions are solution to this problem. 
Easy Track motion is a lightweight voting considered to have passed if the minimum objections threshold hasn’t been exceeded. As opposed to traditional Aragon votings, Easy Track motions are cheaper (no need to vote ‘pro’, token holders only have to vote ‘contra’ if they have objections) and easier to manage (no need to ask broad DAO community vote on proposals sparking no debate). 

## Use cases for Easy Track motions

There are three types of votings run periodically by the Lido DAO that are proposed to be wrapped into the new Easy Track motions.
- Node Operators increasing staking limits
- Funds being allocated into reward programs
- Funds being allocated to LEGO program
